<h1>ðŸ’¥100 JavaScript Projects in 100 DaysðŸ’¥</h1>
This is a repository containing 100 JavaScript projects that I will be working on for the next 100 days. Each project is designed to help me improve my JavaScript skills and gain experience working with various libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
<h1></h1>
<h1>Motivation</h1>

The main motivation behind this project is to challenge myself to code every day and improve my skills as a JavaScript developer. By creating 100 projects in 100 days, I hope to develop a better understanding of JavaScript and its capabilities, as well as gain experience working with various tools and technologies.

The projects in this repository are organized into folders, each containing a separate project. The folders are numbered based on the day the project was completed, starting with day-01 and ending with day-100.

Each project folder contains a README.md file that describes the project and its functionality. Additionally, the source code for each project is included in its respective folder.
<h1>Running the Projects
</h1>

I will be using vite so simply clone the project and inside the folder type in npm install then type in the command npm run dev 
<h1>Conclusion</h1>


I'm excited to start this 100-day journey of coding and improving my skills as a JavaScript developer. I hope that by sharing my progress on GitHub, I can inspire others to embark on their own coding challenges and improve their skills as well. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me!
